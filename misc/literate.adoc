Literate programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like Haskell, [logo]#Idris# supports _literate_ programming.
If a file has an extension of `.lidr` then it is assumed to be a literate file.
In literate programs, everything is assumed to be a comment unless the line begins with a greater than sign `>`, for example:

----
> module literate

This is a comment.
The main program is below

> main : IO ()
> main = putStrLn "Hello literate world!\n"
----

An additional restriction is that there must be a blank line between a program line (beginning with `>`) and a comment line (beginning with any other character).
