Cumulativity
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since values can appear in types and _vice versa_, it is natural that types themselves have types.
For example:

----
*universe> :t Nat
Nat : Type
*universe> :t Vect
Vect : Nat -> Type -> Type
----

But what about the type of `Type`? If we ask [logo]#Idris# it reports

----
*universe> :t Type
Type : Type 1
----

If `Type` were its own type, it would lead to an inconsistency due to Girard’s paradox <<girard-thesis>>, so internally there is a _hierarchy_ of types (or _universes_):

----
Type : Type 1 : Type 2 : Type 3 : ...
----

Universes are _cumulative_, that is, if `x : Type n` we can also have that `x : Type m`, as long as `n < m`.
The typechecker generates such universe constraints and reports an error if any inconsistencies are found.
Ordinarily, a programmer does not need to worry about this, but it does prevent (contrived) programs such as the following:

----
myid : (a : Type) -> a -> a
myid _ x = x

idid :  (a : Type) -> a -> a
idid = myid _ myid
----

The application of `myid` to itself leads to a cycle in the universe hierarchy — `myid`’s first argument is a `Type`, which cannot be at a lower level than required if it is applied to itself.
