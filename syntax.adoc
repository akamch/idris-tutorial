== Syntax Extensions

[logo]#Idris# supports the implementation of _Embedded Domain Specific Languages_ (EDSLs) in several ways <<res-dsl-padl12>>.

Another important way is to allow extension of the core syntax.
In this section we describe two ways of extending the syntax: `syntax` rules and `dsl` notation.
